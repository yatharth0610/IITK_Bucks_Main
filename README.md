# IITK_Bucks_Main
This repo contains the main implementation of the application that i have built as a part of the summer project under the science and 
technology council, IIT Kanpur. It involved building a fully functional blockchain and aimed at learning the working of blockchains through 
building one of our own.

# Running the program
To run the server:

```
npm install
node/nodemon app.js
```
This is just the program of a single node and there would be various other similar nodes running their application. 

Also for making the process of geneating transactions, adding aliases, checking balance and generating keys easier i have built a command-line interaction for the process which is a standalone program under the name interaction.js.

# About the project
Complete codebase has been built using javascript and the project 
definitely helped me strenghthen my skills in using this extremely powerful language. 

During the project i came across various difficulties and learnt various new programming concepts -:

1. **Handling asynchronous calls** : Resolving these issues was definitely the most daunting part of the project for me. I spent hours figuring out these errors as i had no idea about this side of
javascript. This led to me learning about async, await and promises in javascript.

2. **Working with multithreaded programs** : Working with multithreading in my program helped me to understand various subtle features of the language such as event loops, threads and also what happens behind the scenes while running a node.js program. Also i learnt about the usefulness of parallelisation and how efficient this technique can be in various scenarios.

3. **Working with a large code-base** : The only regret i have in this project is that i was not able to maintain such a large code-base and just kept on accumulating all the stuff in a single file, which i really hope on rectifying soon. This really increased the time i took for debugging my application and definitely lowered my efficiency which i really hope to improve upon in any upcoming projects.

4. **Getting access to a universal hostname** : This was also an interesting part of the project where we learnt how to get a universal hostname using tunneling softwares. We majorly relied on ngrok for this purpose and tested our application using that.

And leaving beside these difficult times, i really enjoyed my time programming all the tasks and understanding the basics of the blockchain technology and learning various techniques of making secure and private/anonymous systems using asymmetric cryptography and various other ideas used in modern day cryptocurrencies. It definitely opened up the possibilities of exploring this field more and possibly contributing to this field in future. 

I think it took a good amount of effort working on the application and overall i found the project extremely fruitful for a newbie like me.  

Hope someone finds this repository useful.
